    - Aims to merge pictures more conveniently.
    - Syntax: `merged_picture = merge_pictures(working_directory)`
* Towers.of.Hanoi
    - Animation of the solutions to Towers of Hanoi.
    - Syntax: `toh(N)` or `toh_Ch(N)`
* DIY_Logo: some programs handling with the pictures
    - run.m
        + Start demonstrate all the programs.
        + Syntax: `run`
    - letterz.m, letterj.m, letteru.m, and lettert.m (letter*.m)
        + Draw the shape of letters Z, J, U, T respectively.
        + Syntax: `letter*(N)`, N ranges from 0 to 255
    - diylogo_gray.m and diylogo_rgb.m
        + Combine letters and generate a picture.
        + Syntax: 
            1. `diylogo_gray(string, depth)`
            2. `diylogo_rgb(string, depth, RGB)`

## R

* area_classification: the project to participate in Alibaba big data contest.

## C

* `count_days.c`: to calculate the day of the year.
* `sort_chars.c`: to sort characters/letters.
* `student_scores.c`: to calculate the average scores by courses/students.
